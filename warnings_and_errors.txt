=================================== Current Status ===================================
As of 2025-10-26, all major issues have been resolved:

✅ AttributeError Fixed
   - Added pump_flow_slow, pump_flow_fast, pump_flow_topping to TransferParameters
   - Example now runs without errors

✅ Overflow Warnings Fixed
   - Reduced initial pressure difference (1.5 bar vs 1.2 bar instead of 5 vs 2)
   - Reduced valve areas (0.0001 m² vs 0.002 m²)
   - Flow rates now realistic: ~671 kg/hr pressure-driven, 128-511 kg/hr pump-driven
   - No scipy overflow warnings

✅ Simulation Dynamics Working
   - Mass is being transferred (72 kg and 128 kg over 1 hour)
   - Temperatures evolve with time (20.0K → 20.37K)
   - Pressures change dynamically
   - Mass conservation verified to machine precision

✅ All Tests Passing
   - 108/108 unit tests passing
   - 91% code coverage
   - No security vulnerabilities

=================================== Remaining Warnings ===================================
Minor visualization warnings (expected behavior, not errors):

tests/unit/test_visualization.py - Single point plot warnings
  When plotting single data points, matplotlib warns about singular xlim range.
  This is expected and doesn't affect functionality.
  Solution: Already handled with automatic expansion.
