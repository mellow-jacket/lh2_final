# LH₂ Transfer Model

This repository contains a set of MATLAB scripts developed to simulate **liquid hydrogen (LH₂) transfer processes** in refueling stations. The model supports the design and analysis of LH₂ operations for **heavy-duty vehicle fueling**, with a focus on minimizing venting and optimizing thermal behavior.

The model and its results are formally presented in the following peer-reviewed publication:

> **Gil, A., Flores, R., Brouwer, J.**  
> *Modeling and improving liquid hydrogen transfer processes*,  
> **Applied Energy**, Volume 390, 2025, 125779.

## 📌 Objective

This simulation tool is designed to:
- Simulate LH₂ transfer between cryogenic tanks (e.g., trailer to station, or station to onboard).
- Track **boil-off gas (BOG)** generation and **venting** during transfer.
- Compare driving strategies:  **pressurization** vs. **pump-driven** transfer.
- Evaluate key process parameters including **flow rate**, **inlet temperature**, and **cooling strategies**.

## 🧠 Model Description

- The model is a **0D, lumped-parameter thermodynamic model**.
- It performs transient mass and energy balances on both the liquid and vapor phases of LH₂.
- Key features include:
  - Environmental heat ingress through the tank walls
  - Liquid-vapor thermal stratification
  - Phase change and venting dynamics
  - Transfer control logic

### 🔬 Scientific Foundations

This model is built upon and extends the methodology developed by:

> **Petitpas, G., Aceves, S., Morris, J. et al.**  
> *Modeling of liquid hydrogen boil-off in cryogenic pressure vessels*,  
> **International Journal of Hydrogen Energy**, Volume 44, Issue 3, 2019, pp. 1943–1953.  
> https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijhydene.2018.11.080

The original framework was adapted to simulate dynamic refueling conditions and extended to include pump-driven transfer and top-fill strategies.

### ⚙️ Thermodynamic Properties

- All fluid properties are computed using **NIST's REFPROP** package.
